    "summary": "I am an incredibly passionate enthusiast about everything related to tech, I live tech, it's part of my daily life! I get genuinely so excited about both producing, experimenting with and testing out new technologies, it's thrilling to see new ideas shape the world and people's lives in a completely new way, for the better.I would call myself an avid learner, with a burning desire to understand how things work from every level of its implementation. I spend hours each day fully-immersed in tech including thousands of small personal projects from making my own cloud-storage server with AWS S3-style Object Storage, spontaneous and inventive ideas such as hosting a Steam library over iSCSI using ZFS w/deduplication over a small peer-to-peer Thunderbolt 3 network, to just living and breathing the stuff every day. I'm here for the new experiences, to learn and to grow as a person and to be able to work towards the best I can do, with code and projects that I can be proud of.",
